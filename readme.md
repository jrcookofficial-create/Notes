Yana is a powerful notebook app which allows
you to manage local workspaces of hierarchically structured taggable
and searchable notes. It supports multiple kinds of notes, currently
rich-text notes (including embedded media and complex tables) and code
snippets (based on the VSCode editor frontend) are supported. Other
features include

- Manage note structure via drag-and-drop
- Rich notes editor powered by the Atlassian editor core
- Multiple local workspaces
- Multiple notes can be opened at once in tabs
- Starring of notes
- Trashcan functionality
- Scalability, working fluently even on notebooks with ten thousands of notes

If you want to start developing Yana locally, you need Node 14+ and yarn install. Clone the repo,
install dependencies with `yarn` and start the app locally with `yarn start`.

Note that, after the electron window has opened, it might not automatically refresh when the web
package has finished building. Refresh the container with `CTRL+R` to see the app. You can
open up Devtools with `CTRL+SHIFT+i`.
